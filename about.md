My name is Zach. I'm a [standard nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N00a9O887Q) living in Madison, WI. I currently work in IT at a media company, handling desktop engineering and support.

This site is where I plan to collect things that I have found helpful, interesting, neat, whatever.

I'm not sure why you are still here. This sounds really boring.
